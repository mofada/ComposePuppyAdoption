## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
A pet adoption procedure by [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), I feel pretty good about myself
- List of dogs and pets that can be adopted
- Click on each pet to enter the pet details page
- There is a `call` button in the lower right corner of the pet, click to make a call to contact the pet owner (the call function is not yet implemented, this is just a `Snack`)
- Click back on the title bar to return to the list again

<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
This is a new thing, very new and new thing. I have used flutter before. When I first came into contact with it, I felt that everything was familiar, but it was not the same. Thank you Mr. Zhu (@rengwuxian) for your WeChat audition. Class, let me get started successfully
